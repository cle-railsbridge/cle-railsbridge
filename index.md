Do you dream of someday writing software that helps people and improves the world?

Led by an all-volunteer team of seasoned, enthusiastic Ruby and Rails developers, the workshop introduces people of all backgrounds to the concepts, tools, and techniques of Ruby and Rails development. This workshop is intended to reach out to women, transgender and non-binary people, and people of color who have little or no programing experience.

We welcome you to the Cleveland Ruby community. Whatever your goal is in learning to program, we hope to connect you with the tools to take the next step.
