### InstallFest

Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding

Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need. Bandwidth will be at a premium during the workshop tomorrow, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already.

There are a lot of steps, and the instructions may seem like they're in a foreign language, but: don't panic! By the end of the workshop, you'll know what everything is and how to use it.

You will be installing the following tools:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or other text editor
- Various useful "ruby gems", including...
  - bundler
  - sqlite

You will also create a free account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), an application hosting platform.

If you already have an account on Heroku, make sure you know your username and password.
