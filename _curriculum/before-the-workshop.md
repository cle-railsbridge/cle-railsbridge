### Prepare for the Installfest

**You must bring:**

1. Your laptop. You need to have a working wifi connection and a browser. If you have a choice between a Mac and a Windows laptop, please bring the Mac. Linux is an acceptable alternative, but the Installfest is only tested on Ubuntu.

2. Power cord for your laptop

3. If you already have accounts on Heroku or GitHub, make sure you know your username and password.
